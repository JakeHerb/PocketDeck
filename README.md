# PocketDeck
Currently the app is very much in development. Right now, the goal isn't to have it looking pretty, but to get core functionality started.
Current TODO's are:

[ ] Create a dynamic player hand

[ ] Allow user to place cards on their "table"

[ ] Add sounds

[ ] Make mute button functional

[ ] Get rid of "magic numbers" when it comes to layout, so it doesn't matter what device someone uses

[ ] Make home page look nicer

[ ] Make single device page look nicer

[ ] (Eventually) Support multiple devices sharing a deck

And plenty more.
