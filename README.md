# PocketDeck
Currently the app is very much in development. Right now, the goal isn't to have it looking pretty, but to get core functionality started.
Current TODO's are:

[X] Create a dynamic player hand

[X] Add animation to player hand, allowing as many cards as the user wants, and ability to hide the hand

[X] Improve hand animations that change depending on the users device.

[X] Add ability to detect users touching specific cards, and react accordingly

[ ] Add longpress ability to the Deck, bringing up "Shuffle", "Cut", and "Move" buttons

[ ] Get rid of buttons

[X] Allow user to place cards on their "table"

[X] Create CardOnTableListener() that allows users to add cards back to the hand, flip cards over, or "burn" cards

[ ] Create ability to place cards into a specific location in the hand, moving the cards around dynamically

[ ] Add sounds

[ ] Make mute button functional

[ ] Get rid of "magic numbers" when it comes to layout, so it doesn't matter what device someone uses

[ ] Make home page look nicer

[ ] Make single device page look nicer

[ ] (Eventually) Support multiple devices sharing a deck

And plenty more.
